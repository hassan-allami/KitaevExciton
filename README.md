# KitaevExciton
computes and plots Kitaev Excitons using exact diagonalization method

## File Description

### `Kitaev_Spectrum.py`
> contains the main functions for solving the Kitaev Hamiltonian with holes and computing the spectral functions and absorption spectra.

### `absorption_EV_plots_3row.py`
> plots absorption spectrum of a chain as $V$ changing.
> Including the full spectrum and spatially resolved spectra at different sites.

### `absorption_long_chain_tau.py`
> plots absorption spectrum of a long chain as $\tau$ changing.
> Including the full spectrum and spatially resolved spectra at different sites.
